<p><strong>7.2 Exclusions.</strong> The foregoing warranty shall apply only to the Startup.ML Code licensed under the Enterprise Standard or Enterprise Premium edition of the Software, and shall not apply to any nonconformity resulting from any hardware, operating system or other software to any Startup.ML Code that was licensed under the Enterprise Developer edition of the Software or that was (a) used in violation of this Agreement, (b) used, handled, operated, maintained or stored improperly, or in any manner not in accord with the Documentation, industry standard practice or Licensor’s instructions or recommendations, or (c) combined, altered, modified or repaired other than by or for Licensor.   </p>

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS, LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, INTEGRATION, ACCURACY, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE. </p>
<h3 id="8-indemnification">8. Indemnification</h3>
<p><strong>8.1 Infringement.</strong> Except as provided below, Licensor agrees to defend Licensee against any claim by a third party that the Startup.ML Code infringes a valid US patent (issued as of the Effective Date), or any copyright or trade secret, of such third party, and to indemnify Licensee for settlement amounts or damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) awarded and arising out of such claim; provided, that (a) Licensee promptly gives Licensor written notice thereof and reasonable cooperation, information, and assistance in connection therewith, and (b) Licensor shall have sole control and authority to defend, settle or compromise such claim. If any Software becomes or, in Licensor’s opinion, is likely to become the subject of any injunction preventing its use as contemplated herein, Licensor may, at its option (1) obtain for Licensee the right to continue using such Startup.ML Code, or (2) replace or modify such Startup.ML Code so that it becomes non-infringing without substantially compromising its principal functions. If (1) and (2) are not reasonably available to Licensor, then Licensor may (3) terminate this Agreement upon written notice and, after return of the Software, refund to Licensee the pre-paid Subscription Fees, pro-rated for the remainder of the Subscription Term for which such fees have been pre-paid.   </p>

<h3 id="10-term-and-termination">10. Term and Termination</h3>
<p><strong>10.1 Term.</strong> This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue in effect for the Subscription Term unless specified otherwise in the Sales Order. Thereafter, and unless otherwise specified in the Order Form, this Agreement shall automatically renew for the same Subscription Term duration specified in the initial Sales Order unless either party notifies the other in writing of its intention not to renew by no later than sixty (60) days before the expiration of the then-current term.   </p>
<p><strong>10.2 Termination.</strong> This Agreement may be terminated (a) by either party if the other party materially breaches a provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within 30 days (10 days in the case of any non-payment) after receiving written notice of such breach from the non-breaching party; or (b) by either party immediately upon written notice, if the other party makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors, or a receiver, trustee in bankruptcy or similar officer is appointed to take charge of any or all of the other party’s property, or the other party seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding or such a proceeding is instituted against the other party and is not dismissed within 90 days, or the other party becomes insolvent or, without a successor, dissolves, liquidates or otherwise fails to operate in the ordinary course.   </p>
<p><strong>10.3 Effects of Termination.</strong> Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, all rights, obligations and licenses of the parties hereunder shall cease, except that (a) all obligations that accrued prior to the effective date of termination and any remedies for breach of this Agreement shall survive any termination, (b) Licensee shall promptly return or destroy all Software and other tangible Confidential Information, and permanently erase all Confidential Information from any computer and storage media, and (c) the provisions of Sections 4 (Payments), 5 (Confidentiality), 6 (Proprietary Rights), 7 (Warranty and Disclaimers), 8 (Indemnification), 9 (Limitation of Liability), 11 (General Provisions) and this Section 10.3 shall also survive. </p>
<h3 id="11-general-provisions">11. General Provisions</h3>
<p><strong>11.1 Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement including the Sales Order, constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior negotiations, understandings or agreements (oral or written), between the parties about the subject matter of this Agreement. Terms set forth in any Licensee’s document that are in addition to or at variance with the terms of this Agreement are specifically waived by Licensee. All such terms are considered to be proposed material alterations of this Agreement and are hereby rejected. No waiver, consent or modification of this Agreement shall bind either party unless in writing and signed by the party against which enforcement is sought, except the terms of this Agreement may be modified by Licensor from time to time so long as they do not result in a diminution of the rights granted hereunder. The most recent revision of this Agreement will be posted on http://sibyl.startup.ml/license/. By downloading updates delivered pursuant to the support and maintenance services, Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms of the Agreement then in effect. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period will not be construed as a waiver of such rights. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is in English only, which shall be controlling in all respects. No version of this Agreement in another language shall be binding or of any effect.   </p>
<p><strong>11.2 Governing Law.</strong> This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. In the event of any conflict between US and foreign laws, rules and regulations, U.S. laws, rules and regulations shall govern. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement.   </p>
<p><strong>11.3 Remedies.</strong> Unless specifically provided otherwise, each right and remedy in this Agreement is in addition to any other right or remedy, at law or in equity. Licensee agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of Section 5 or 6, Licensor will suffer irreparable damage for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Licensor shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable remedies to prevent or restrain such breach or threatened breach, without the necessity of posting any bond.   </p>
<p><strong>11.4 Notices.</strong> Any notice or communication hereunder shall be in writing and either personally delivered, or sent via confirmed electronic mail, or sent via recognized express delivery courier or certified or registered mail, prepaid and return receipt requested, addressed to the other party at its address specified above or in the Sales Order, or at such other address designated in a subsequent notice. All notices shall be in English, effective upon receipt.   </p>
<p><strong>11.5 Assignment.</strong> This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder are personal to Licensee, and may not be assigned or otherwise transferred, in whole or in part, without Licensor’s prior written consent. Any attempt to do otherwise shall be void and of no effect. Without Licensee’s consent, Licensor may assign this Agreement to any third party. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors, representatives and permitted assigns of the parties.   </p>
<p><strong>11.6 Government License.</strong> If any user of the Software or Documentation is a department, agency or other entity of the US Government, then use, duplication, reproduction, modification, release, disclosure or transfer of the Software and Documentation is restricted in accordance with FAR 12.212 for civilian agencies and DFAR 227.7202 for military agencies. The Software is commercial computer software and the Documentation is commercial computer software documentation, and their use is further restricted in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.   </p>
<p><strong>11.7 Non-Solicitation.</strong> The Licensor and Licensee agree that during the Term of the Agreement and for a period of one (1) year following its expiration or termination, neither of them will entice, solicit or encourage any employee of the other party to leave such party’s employ; provided, that either party may hire an employee of the other party who, without individual solicitation, responds to advertisements or solicitations targeted at the general public.   </p>
<p><strong>11.8 Acknowledgment.</strong> Licensee acknowledges that (a) it has read and understands this Agreement, (b) it has had an opportunity to have its legal counsel review this Agreement, (c) this Agreement has the same force and effect as a signed agreement, (d) Licensor requires identification of the Licensee before issuing this license, and (e) issuance of this license does not constitute general publication of the Software, Documentation or Confidential Information.   </p>
<p><strong>11.9 Marketing and Promotion.</strong> Licensee agrees to participate in marketing and promotional activities for Licensor, including press releases, white papers and case studies.</p>

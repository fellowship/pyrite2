#Sibyl: Anomaly Detection in High Dimensional Heterogeneous Datasets

## Overview

Sibyl is an anomaly detection tool optimized for high-dimensional, heterogeneous (both categorical and continuous) datasets.   Its time complexity is near linear and space complexity is quadratic to the number of dimensions.

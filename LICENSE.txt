GENERAL PROVISIONS. 11.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement including the Sales Order, constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior negotiations, understandings or agreements (oral or written), between the parties about the subject matter of this Agreement. Terms set forth in any Licensee’s document that are in addition to or at variance with the terms of this Agreement are specifically waived by Licensee. All such terms are considered to be proposed material alterations of this Agreement and are hereby rejected. No waiver, consent or modification of this Agreement shall bind either party unless in writing and signed by the party against which enforcement is sought, except the terms of this Agreement may be modified by Licensor from time to time so long as they do not result in a diminution of the rights granted hereunder. The most recent revision of this Agreement will be posted on http://voltdb.com/software-license-agreement. By downloading updates delivered pursuant to the support and maintenance services, Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms of the Agreement then in effect. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period will not be construed as a waiver of such rights. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is in English only, which shall be controlling in all respects. No version of this Agreement in another language shall be binding or of any effect.   11.2 Governing Law.

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement.   11.3 Remedies. Unless specifically provided otherwise, each right and remedy in this Agreement is in addition to any other right or remedy, at law or in equity. Licensee agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of Section 5 or 6, Licensor will suffer irreparable damage for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Licensor shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable remedies to prevent or restrain such breach or threatened breach, without the necessity of posting any bond.   11.4 Notices. Any notice or communication hereunder shall be in writing and either personally delivered, or sent via confirmed electronic mail, or sent via recognized express delivery courier or certified or registered mail, prepaid and return receipt requested, addressed to the other party at its address specified above or in the Sales Order, or at such other address designated in a subsequent notice. All notices shall be in English, effective upon receipt.   11.5 Assignment. This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder are personal to Licensee, and may not be assigned or otherwise transferred, in whole or in part, without Licensor’s prior written consent. Any attempt to do otherwise shall be void and of no effect. Without Licensee’s consent, Licensor may assign this Agreement to any third party. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors, representatives and permitted assigns of the parties.   11.6 Government License.

The Licensor and Licensee agree that during the Term of the Agreement and for a period of one (1) year following its expiration or termination, neither of them will entice, solicit or encourage any employee of the other party to leave such party’s employ; provided, that either party may hire an employee of the other party who, without individual solicitation, responds to advertisements or solicitations targeted at the general public.   11.8 Acknowledgment. Licensee acknowledges that (a) it has read and understands this Agreement, (b) it has had an opportunity to have its legal counsel review this Agreement, (c) this Agreement has the same force and effect as a signed agreement, (d) Licensor requires identification of the Licensee before issuing this license, and (e) issuance of this license does not constitute general publication of the Software, Documentation or Confidential Information.   11.9 Marketing and Promotion.

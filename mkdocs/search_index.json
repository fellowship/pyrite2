Its time complexity is near linear and space complexity is quadratic to the number of dimensions.\n\n\nSibyl is designed for categorical features (e.g., city can contain 'San Francisco', 'Boston', etc.) however it can also handle numerical features (e.g., income, age, etc) through discretization.    \n\n\nGetting started\n\n\nfrom sibyl import Sibyl\nsibyl_data = Sibyl(pandas.read_csv('expanded.csv'))\nscore_vec = sibyl_data.score_dataset(50, 100)\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nSibyl uses the following dependencies:\n\n\n\n\nnumpy\n\n\npandas\n\n\nmatplotlib\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have the dependencies installed, download the distro:\n\n\nwget http://...\n\n\n\n\nGo to the Sibyl folder and run the install command:\n\n\ncd sibyl\nsudo python setup.py install\n\n\n\n\nPlease review the \nlicense terms\n before installing and using Sibyl.\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nPlease email your questions and comments to \nStartup.ML\n.",

The returned object provides the necessary methods for anomaly scoring either a single instance or the entire dataset.\n\n\n\n\ninit\n(self, dataframe)\n\n\nArguments\n:\n\n\ndataframe\n: Pandas Dataframe\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn\n: Sibyl object over which we detect anomalies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnomaly Scoring\n\n\nOnce the dataframe is loaded, we randomly sample rows from the dataframe with replacement. The number of times we sample from the dataframe is controlled by: \nsample_num\n and number of instances picked in each sample is controlled by: \nsample_size\n. Sibyl can be used to compute an anomaly score for each instance in the dataset (via score_dataset), or for a single instance (via score_instance).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscore_dataset\n(sample_num, sample_size)\n\n\n\n\nArguments\n:\n\n\nsample_num\n: int (number of random samples chosen without replacement from the dataset).\n\n\nsample_size\n: int (size of the random sample)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn\n: numpy.ndarray (a list where the i_th element is the anomaly score for the i_th instance in the dataset).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscore_instance\n(single_instance, sample_num, sample_size)\n\n\n\n\nArguments\n:\n\n\nsingle_instance\n: pandas.Series (a single instance for which the anomaly score is to be computed)\n\n\nsample_num\n: int (number of random samples chosen without replacement from the dataset)\n\n\nsample_size\n: int (size of the random sample)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn\n: float (Anomaly score for the single instance)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature Importance\n\n\nSibyl provides a way to further explore the anomalous instances in a dataset, through supplying a list of features, and feature-pairs, that contribute the most in its anomaly score and thus gain insights on why an instance was classified as an anomaly.\n\n\n\n\nget_feature_importance\n(single_instance)\n\n\nArguments\n:\n\n\nsingle_instance\n: pandas.Series (a single instance for which the anomaly score is to be computed)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn\n: A dictionary consisting of the most important single feature in the anomaly score, as well as the single most important pair of features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninstance_inspect\n(single_instance, plot)\n\n\nArguments\n:\n\n\nsingle_instance\n: pandas.Series (a single instance for which the anomaly score is to be computed)\n\n\nplot\n: Boolean, to show plots of the freq_1d and freq_2d values\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturn\n:\n\n\nfreq_1d\n: ndarray, containing the inverse relative frequency for each single feautre.\n\n\nfreq_2d\n: dxd ndarray, where ith column and jth row corresponds to the anomaly score due to features i and j.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreprocessing\n\n\nDiscretization of numeric features can be done manually or as a pre-processing step within Sibyl.",

Terms set forth in any Licensee\u2019s document that are in addition to or at variance with the terms of this Agreement are specifically waived by Licensee. All such terms are considered to be proposed material alterations of this Agreement and are hereby rejected. No waiver, consent or modification of this Agreement shall bind either party unless in writing and signed by the party against which enforcement is sought, except the terms of this Agreement may be modified by Licensor from time to time so long as they do not result in a diminution of the rights granted hereunder. The most recent revision of this Agreement will be posted on http://sibyl.startup.ml/license/. By downloading updates delivered pursuant to the support and maintenance services, Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms of the Agreement then in effect. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period will not be construed as a waiver of such rights. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is in English only, which shall be controlling in all respects.

The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement.   \n\n\n11.3 Remedies.\n Unless specifically provided otherwise, each right and remedy in this Agreement is in addition to any other right or remedy, at law or in equity. Licensee agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of Section 5 or 6, Licensor will suffer irreparable damage for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Licensor shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable remedies to prevent or restrain such breach or threatened breach, without the necessity of posting any bond.   \n\n\n11.4 Notices.\n Any notice or communication hereunder shall be in writing and either personally delivered, or sent via confirmed electronic mail, or sent via recognized express delivery courier or certified or registered mail, prepaid and return receipt requested, addressed to the other party at its address specified above or in the Sales Order, or at such other address designated in a subsequent notice. All notices shall be in English, effective upon receipt.   \n\n\n11.5 Assignment.\n This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder are personal to Licensee, and may not be assigned or otherwise transferred, in whole or in part, without Licensor\u2019s prior written consent. Any attempt to do otherwise shall be void and of no effect. Without Licensee\u2019s consent, Licensor may assign this Agreement to any third party. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors, representatives and permitted assigns of the parties.   \n\n\n11.6 Government License.\n If any user of the Software or Documentation is a department, agency or other entity of the US Government, then use, duplication, reproduction, modification, release, disclosure or transfer of the Software and Documentation is restricted in accordance with FAR 12.212 for civilian agencies and DFAR 227.7202 for military agencies. The Software is commercial computer software and the Documentation is commercial computer software documentation, and their use is further restricted in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.   \n\n\n11.7 Non-Solicitation.\n The Licensor and Licensee agree that during the Term of the Agreement and for a period of one (1) year following its expiration or termination, neither of them will entice, solicit or encourage any employee of the other party to leave such party\u2019s employ; provided, that either party may hire an employee of the other party who, without individual solicitation, responds to advertisements or solicitations targeted at the general public.   \n\n\n11.8 Acknowledgment.\n Licensee acknowledges that (a) it has read and understands this Agreement, (b) it has had an opportunity to have its legal counsel review this Agreement, (c) this Agreement has the same force and effect as a signed agreement, (d) Licensor requires identification of the Licensee before issuing this license, and (e) issuance of this license does not constitute general publication of the Software, Documentation or Confidential Information.   \n\n\n11.9 Marketing and Promotion.\n Licensee agrees to participate in marketing and promotional activities for Licensor, including press releases, white papers and case studies.",
